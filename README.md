# Projects-For-Fun
A variety of fun projects that utilize neural networks and computer vision. All based off of my own datasets!
"AP Research" is my first implementation of an original neural network, meaning that I built it from scratch without any source code;
instead I based everything from the math and equations behind machine learning. Here, my goal was to see how accurate I could make a neural
network from theory alone. The network was trained to differenciate between a two series of numbers (sigma(n) and sigma(2n)).
Both classifiers were made as I was completing Fast.ai's deep learning course. I created my own datasets from Google Images and applied
different pretrained convolutional neural networks on them.
